# PneumoNet: Neural networks for the detection of pneumonia from digital lung auscultation audio


Precise lung sounds classification is still an open issue: traditional auscultation methods are
limited due to biased human interpretation. This paper introduce two CNN models, which differ in the way
audio crops are combined and fed to the network. They recognize specific audio patterns in the STFT
spectrograms and classify healthy and unhealthy pediatric patients, suffering from different pulmonary
diseases. Two different datasets are investigated and compared rigorously; however, the attempts to find a
general model that performed well on both sets were not successful. After a weighted mean aggregation method,
both models achieved an accuracy of 94%.
